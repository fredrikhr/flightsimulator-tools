# Tools for Microsoft Flight Simulator development

## SDK download

The Microsoft Flight Simulator SDK can be downloaded from the following URL template:

```txt
https://sdk.flightsimulator.com/files/installers/<version>/MSFS_SDK_Core_Installer_<full-version>.msi
```

In the template above, replace `<version>` by the short semver-style version of the MSFS SDK and `<full-version>` by the long 4-component-version number.  
The version number currently in use is declared in [MSFS_SDK.Version.props](./MSFS_SDK.Version.props)
